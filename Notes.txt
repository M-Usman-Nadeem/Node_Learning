Modules:
It is a piece of code that has its own context 
In Node.js,each file is considered as a module

There are three types of modules.
1:Local Modules-We create in our application.
2:BuiltIn Modules
3:Third Party Modules.

---To add Modules in our code 
 or to load a module into another file we use:
 require() function

 when we import a module(file),
node.js wraps it inside a function that 
gives us a different scope of every module and
protects us from conflicts like having same name of variables or functions.

Module Wrapper:
Each Module Wrap into a IIFE before being loaded.
IIFE gives the variable scope to the module instead of the global object.


Each function wrapper has 5 parameter like this
(function(exports,require,module,__filename__dirname){ 
// module code comes here})
Require==> it is the function through which we export the module by passing a path as an argument.
__dirname==it is the directory name where is the file is 
__filename==> it is the complete src of file name
module==>it is the object which is the object has different type of key-value pairs.
exports==>
